### üöÄ Download your Phind, Perplexity and MaxAI-Google search threads into markdown files!

üòé Why Save my Chatbot?
- To keep AI generated information offline,
- To share threads with others,
- To read and process in a knowledge base / note-taking app (like Obsidian),
- To improve the Phind website usability.

üëâ When you are on Phind, Perplexity or Google (with MaxAI integration), simply click on the extension icon. It will automatically export the thread you are currently on into a formatted markdown file.

üòÆ This extension also adds export options directly inside the Phind interface. Now, you can export all your threads clicking on a simple button!

‚úÖ Enjoy!

‚úèÔ∏è Please note that this project is not affiliated with Phind, Perplexity nor MaxAI.
