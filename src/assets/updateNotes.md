# Update notes
# 2.1.10
⨠ 🛸 Avoiding the mess
Phind changed its UI, so the extension was a bit lost. Now, it's back on track! Sorry for the inconvenience!


# 2.1.5
⨠ ⭐ New branding, same extension, always better!
"Save My Phind" is now "Save my Chatbot"! But it's still exporting your Phind threads, don't worry!

⨠ 🚀 Now exports Perplexity threads!
Click on the extension icon when you're on Perplexity.ai and see the magic happen!

⨠ 💡 Some format bugs solved
Newlines inside links won't be a problem anymore.

# v1.9.18
⨠ 🚀 Fix Basic Search export errors
Some errors were occuring when trying to export a Basic Search thread. It's now fixed!

⨠ 🧩 A better integration in the Phind interface
Made some UI progress and solved bugs to improve the integration in the Phind interface.

⨠ 💡 Some format bugs solved
Special characters inside links won't be a problem anymore.

# v1.9.9
⨠ 🔎 Filter your threads list!
You just want to retrieve that damn chat you started 5 days ago? No problem: start typing in the filter bar to find it quickly!

⨠ 🚀 File export improvements
Hoora! The file name now contains the tool used (New Phind or Basic search). In addition, some format bugs are solved...

⨠ 💡 Some UI progress 
Tried to improve the Phind global UI (hard but needed!). Plus, extension compenents are better integrated in the Phind interface. 

⨠ 🧩 Other changes under the hood
Some code refactoring, bugs solved and quirky improvements... You know, the usual stuff.

# v1.8.4
⨠ Now inside the Phind interface!
You can now export a Phind thread using the button inside the page (but you always can click on the extension icon).

⨠ Export all your threads in 1 click!
Just click on the "Export All Threads" button! It could be long, so you have time to drink your triple coffee dose 🙃.

⨠ Some bugs solved
File names, title bugs, these kind of things...
